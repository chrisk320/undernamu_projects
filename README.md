Update: Got the assistant working and it is able to call the openFDA tool function. I seperated the code into a few files and added comments.

Instructions: cd into 'Chatbot' and Run 'python3 main.py' in terminal

To-do:
	Make sure the openfda functions work properly and fix the paramater discriptions to be neccessary and correct
 	Integrate thai fda documents 
  	add odoo api funciton calls
